Dom &amp; Template | Data Events and Binding | Reactivity | Styling with Vue

# DOM and Templates
* Vue can be used to define the goal instead of the steps(declarative approach)
* Connect Vue to HTML via "mount": Vue renders the real DOM based on the connected template

# Reactivity
* Vue updates the real DOM for you when bound data changes 
* Computed properties and watchers allow you to react to data changes

# Data and Event Bindings 
* You can bind data via interpolation ({{}}) or the v-bind(":") directive
* You listen for events via v-on ("@")

# Styling 
* Dynamic CSS class and inline style  bindings are supported by Vue
* Vue offers multiple special syntaxes (object-based, array-based) for efficient bindings
